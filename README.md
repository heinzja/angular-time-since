# angular-time-since
 Have you ever needed to track the time since something has last happened instead of how long until something needs to be done? Look no further than Time-Since. The goal of this project is to count up from a given time instead of counting down until a given point in time.

# Use Case:
  - track how long it has been since you have last watered your house plants
  - track the time it has been since your last oil change
  - track in time how long it has been since you last video called your mother
  - etc
